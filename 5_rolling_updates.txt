Let's update the database by replacing existing words with Latvian words!

1. Create words2.sql file with the following:

CREATE TABLE nouns (word TEXT NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE verbs (word TEXT NOT NULL);
CREATE TABLE adjectives (word TEXT NOT NULL);

INSERT INTO nouns(word) VALUES
  ('dators'),
  ('koks'),
  ('zīmulis'),
  ('ūdens'),
  ('cilvēks'),
  ('pele');

INSERT INTO verbs(word) VALUES
  ('lieto'),
  ('skaitļo'),
  ('aug'),
  ('raksta'),
  ('ir'),
  ('ēd');


INSERT INTO adjectives(word) VALUES
  ('akls'),
  ('dzidrs'),
  ('centīgs'),
  ('ciets'),
  ('vecs');  

2. Update db/Dockerfile so it copies the new file to the image
3. Build an image with tag v2, push the image to repository:

`cd k8s-wordsmith-demo`
`docker build -t harbor.svc.<cluster-name>.workshop.base.stacks.delivery/workshop/db:v2 db`
`docker push harbor.svc.<cluster-name>.workshop.base.stacks.delivery/workshop/db:v2`

4. To update the image of the application to version 2, use the set image command, followed by the deployment name and the new image version:
kubectl set image deployments/db db=harbor.svc.viktor.workshop.base.stacks.delivery/workshop/db:v2

5. Run `kubectl get pods` and observe that new image version has been deployed.

5. Observe on UI that Latvian words started to appear

6. Confirm rollout with:
`kubectl rollout status deployments/db`
